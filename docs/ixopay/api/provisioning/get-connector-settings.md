**Example:**`1004`
**errorMessage** stringrequired
Human readable error message.
:::info While the `errorMessage` field provides useful context for understanding the nature of the error, it's important to note that the content of this message can vary based on specific circumstances. For consistent and reliable error handling in your application, always base your logic on the `errorCode` field, not the `errorMessage`. :::

**name:** basicAuth[](https://documentation.ixopay.com/api/provisioning/provisioning-api#authentication)**type:** http**scheme: **basic**description: **To authenticate API requests, the API key and password must be sent as BASIC Authentication in the `Authorization` header,
as defined in [RFC 7617](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7617).
To achieve this, the API key and password are first concatenated with a `:` (colon) separator,

1. Suppose the API key is `01234567-89ab-cdef-0123456789abcdef` and the password is `0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef`.
2. Concatenate the username and password with a `:` separator: `01234567-89ab-cdef-0123456789abcdef:0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef`.

### Generating a Provisioning API Key

1. Navigate to "**System Setup**" followed by "**API Keys**" from the main menu.
2. Click on "**+ New API Key**" located at the top-right corner of the screen.
3. Make sure to select "**Provisioning API**" in the "**Services**" field.
4. Specify any IP addresses that are authorized to access the Provisioning API with this API key.
   - Enter multiple IP addresses in a comma-separated format, with **no** whitespace in between (for instance, "`12.12.12.12,41.41.41.41`").
   - You can also employ [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation)' for specifying IP addresses (for instance, "`10.0.0.0/28`" includes all IP addresses from `10.0.0.0` to `10.0.0.15`).
5. Click on "**+ Create**" to generate your new API Key.
6. It is crucial to securely store the provided password upon creation, as this will be the only opportunity it will be visible to you. Once you navigate away from the page, you'll only have the option to reset the password, not view the existing one.

**name:** basicAuth[](https://documentation.ixopay.com/api/provisioning/provisioning-api#authentication)**type:** http**scheme: **basic**description: **To authenticate API requests, the API key and password must be sent as BASIC Authentication in the `Authorization` header,
as defined in [RFC 7617](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7617).
To achieve this, the API key and password are first concatenated with a `:` (colon) separator,
and the resulting string is then Base64 encoded. Here is an example of how this process works:

1. Suppose the API key is `01234567-89ab-cdef-0123456789abcdef` and the password is `0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef`.
2. Concatenate the username and password with a `:` separator: `01234567-89ab-cdef-0123456789abcdef:0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef`.
3. Base64 encode the concatenated string: `MDEyMzQ1NjctODlhYi1jZGVmLTAxMjM0NTY3ODlhYmNkZWY6MDEyMzQ1Njc4OWFiY2RlZjAxMjM0NTY3ODlhYmNkZWYK`.
4. Finally, include the `Authorization` header in the API request with the Base64 encoded string, like so: `Authorization: Basic MDEyMzQ1NjctODlhYi1jZGVmLTAxMjM0NTY3ODlhYmNkZWY6MDEyMzQ1Njc4OWFiY2RlZjAxMjM0NTY3ODlhYmNkZWYK`.

:::tip
Many programming frameworks will automatically handle the BASIC Authentication process for you once you provide the username (API key) and password to the appropriate request object.

### Generating a Provisioning API Key

1. Navigate to "**System Setup**" followed by "**API Keys**" from the main menu.
2. Click on "**+ New API Key**" located at the top-right corner of the screen.
3. Make sure to select "**Provisioning API**" in the "**Services**" field.
4. Specify any IP addresses that are authorized to access the Provisioning API with this API key.
   - Enter multiple IP addresses in a comma-separated format, with **no** whitespace in between (for instance, "`12.12.12.12,41.41.41.41`").
   - You can also employ [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation)' for specifying IP addresses (for instance, "`10.0.0.0/28`" includes all IP addresses from `10.0.0.0` to `10.0.0.15`).
5. Click on "**+ Create**" to generate your new API Key.
6. It is crucial to securely store the provided password upon creation, as this will be the only opportunity it will be visible to you. Once you navigate away from the page, you'll only have the option to reset the password, not view the existing one.
